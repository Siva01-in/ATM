# ATM

 # Itachi ATM Simulation
 
 A simple Python script that simulates a basic ATM machine. Users can check their balance, deposit, and withdraw money after entering the correct PIN.

***Features*** <br>
  - PIN authentication for security
  - Check account balance
  - Deposit money
  - Withdraw money (with insufficient funds check)
  - Realistic transaction processing delays using ``` time.sleep() ```
  - Friendly prompts and messages

***How It Works*** <br>

  1. The script waits a few seconds to simulate an ATM booting up.
  2. The user is prompted to insert their card and enter their PIN.
  3. If the PIN is correct, the user can:
     - Check their balance
     - Deposit money
     - Withdraw money
  4. Each transaction simulates processing time for a more realistic experience.
  5. The script handles incorrect PINs and insufficient balance scenarios.

***Usage*** <br>
 1. Copy the following code into a Python file (e.g., atm.py):
  
    ```
    import time
    time.sleep(2)
    pin = 1234
    bal = 1000
    print("Welcome to Itachi Atm")
    time.sleep(3)
    print("Insert a your card")
    time.sleep(1)
    p = int(input("Enter a Pin:"))
    if pin == p:
        time.sleep(1)
        print("Transcation Processing.........")
        while True:
        time.sleep(4)
        print("1.Check Balance\n2.Desopit\n3.Withdrawal")
        opt = int(input("Enter a No:"))
        if opt == 1:
            time.sleep(1)
            print("Transcation Processing.........")
            time.sleep(3)
            print("Current balance $", bal)
            time.sleep(2)
            print("Remove your card\n Thanks for visiting a ATM")
            pass
        elif opt == 2:
            print("Transcation Processing.........")
            amt = int(input("Enter a amout to Deposit $ :"))
            bal += amt
            time.sleep(1)
            print("Your Desopit amount $", amt)
            time.sleep(1)
            print("Your current balance is $", bal)
            time.sleep(1)
            print("Deposit Successfully ")
            continue  
        elif opt == 3:
            print("Transcation Processing.........")
            amt = int(input("Enter a amout to Withdirwal $:"))
            if amt < bal:
                bal -= amt
                print("Trancsation procesing...")
                time.sleep(2)
                print("Collect you cash.....")
                time.sleep(2)
                print("Successfully Withdrwal cash\nPlease remove your atm card")
            elif amt > bal:
                print("Insufficient amount\nRemove your atm card\nThanks u for visiting atm")
            else:
                print("Trascation processing....")
                time.sleep(4)
                print("Invaild pin")
                break
    else:
        print("Trascation processing....")
        time.sleep(4)
        print("Invaild pin")

    ```
 3. Run the script:
     ```
     python atm.py
     ```
 4. Follow the on-screen instructions.
